# DNN_golang_training
Repository for my project where I create simple deep neural network using golanguage. I intend to learn more about deep neural networks and to program in go language. I will try to limit AI usage for syntax needs in order to learn programming language
instead of just vibe-coding my way through this project :)

None of this code should ever be used in production, as AI libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow have much better
optimized and less buggy algorithms freely available.

Structure:
Neuron keeps data of bias term and weights, eliminating need for extra datatype connecting neurons to eachother.

Each neuron outputs only one value, and remembers weights of all INCOMING neurons
