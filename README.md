# DNN_golang_training
Repository for my project where I create simple deep neural network using golanguage. I intend to learn more about deep neural networks and to program in go :)

Structure:
Neuron keeps data of bias term and weights, eliminating need for datatype
connecting neurons to eachother.

Each neuron outputs only one value, and remembers weights of INCOMING neurons
